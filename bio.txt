Vineet Pandey is a Human-Computer Interaction researcher and Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at UC San Diego advised by Scott Klemmer at The Design Lab. Vineet builds socio-technical systems that enable people to perform complex, creative work. Vineet’s research uses scientific work (especially human microbiome research) as a petri-dish to create scalable techniques for integrating learning and working. His research platform Gut Instinct has been used by over 600 people from 29 countries to create novel hypotheses, design experiments to test their intuitions, and replicate known results. His research systems have been deployed with the American Gut Project (world's largest crowdfunded citizen science project), Open Humans, and other communities. Vineet’s research is published at leading HCI and Learning conferences, demonstrated at Quantified Self Health Data Exploration Workshop, and invited for talks at MIT Innovation workshop and American Society of Microbiology among others.
